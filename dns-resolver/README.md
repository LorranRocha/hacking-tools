# DNS Resolver

I was studying about DNS protocol so, i decided to write a script to make DNS queries.

I found this useful so, you can use this script if you want.

## How to run

This script needs `sudo` permissions because it needs to open ports and do some other stuffs.

Linux:

```bash
sudo ./resolve-dns.py www.google.com
```

Windows:

```bash
python3 ./resolve-dns.py www.google.com
```
